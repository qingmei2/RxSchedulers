## RxSchedulers

### How to use it

**In Kotlin:**

```kotlin
Observable
        .just(0)
        .delay(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        .switchThread()         // the extension for kotlin
        .subscribe({
            Toast.makeText(this, "onNext: Int = $it", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
        })
```

**In Java:**

```Java
Observable
        .just(0)
        .delay(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        .compose(new RxSchedulerTransformer())
        .subscribe()
```

### RxSchedulerTransformer

RxSchedulerTransformer is a proxy for different Reactive Transformer,So the Developer do not need to implement different **Transformers** based on different types.
:

```kotlin
interface IRxSchedulerTransformer<T, R> : FlowableTransformer<T, R>,
        ObservableTransformer<T, R>,
        MaybeTransformer<T, R>,
        SingleTransformer<T, R>,
        CompletableTransformer
```
